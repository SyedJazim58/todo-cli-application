# Feature Specification: Basic Todo CRUD Operations

**Feature Branch**: `001-basic-level-core-todo-essentials`
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Basic Level – Core Todo Essentials

Target system:
Foundational Todo application forming Phase I of the “Evolution of Todo” project.

Scope & focus:
Define clear, unambiguous specifications for core CRUD functionality that can be
fully generated by Claude Code without manual coding.

Modules to specify:
1. Add Task – Create new todo items
2. Delete Task – Remove existing tasks
3. Update Task – Modify task title or details
4. View Task List – Display all tasks
5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add New Tasks (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to create new todo items so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental capability - without the ability to add tasks, the entire todo system is useless. This forms the foundation for all other operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating new tasks and verifying they appear in the system. The system should accept task creation requests and store them successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the todo application, **When** I add a new task with a title, **Then** the task appears in my task list as incomplete
2. **Given** I have entered task details, **When** I submit the task creation request, **Then** the system confirms successful creation and displays the new task
3. **Given** I am adding a task with title and optional details, **When** I submit the request, **Then** both title and details are preserved in the system

### User Story 2 - View Task List (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to view all my tasks so that I can see what I need to do and track my progress.

**Why this priority**: After adding tasks, the next critical capability is viewing them. This enables users to manage their tasks effectively and forms the basis for other operations like updating and completing tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating several tasks and then viewing the complete task list. The system should display all stored tasks with their relevant information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple tasks in the system, **When** I request to view my task list, **Then** all tasks are displayed in a clear, organized manner
2. **Given** I have both completed and incomplete tasks, **When** I view the task list, **Then** I can distinguish between completed and incomplete tasks
3. **Given** I have added tasks with details, **When** I view the task list, **Then** I can see the details associated with each task

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Tasks as Complete (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress and focus on remaining tasks.

**Why this priority**: This is essential for the todo functionality - the ability to mark tasks as done provides the core value of the system by helping users track completion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by marking tasks as complete and verifying their status changes. The system should update the completion status and reflect this change in displays.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have an incomplete task, **When** I mark it as complete, **Then** its status changes to completed and is reflected in the task list
2. **Given** I have completed a task, **When** I view the task list, **Then** the task is clearly marked as completed
3. **Given** I have completed a task by mistake, **When** I toggle its completion status again, **Then** the task returns to incomplete status

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want to modify task titles or details so that I can keep my tasks accurate and up-to-date.

**Why this priority**: This provides flexibility for users to refine their tasks as needed, making the system more useful for real-world scenarios where task requirements may evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating existing tasks and verifying the changes are preserved. The system should allow modification of task information while maintaining the task identity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task with specific title and details, **When** I update the task title, **Then** the new title is saved and displayed in the task list
2. **Given** I have a task with details, **When** I update the task details, **Then** the new details are saved and accessible
3. **Given** I am editing a task, **When** I cancel the update, **Then** the original task information remains unchanged

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P5)

As a user, I want to remove tasks I no longer need so that my task list remains relevant and manageable.

**Why this priority**: This completes the CRUD cycle and allows users to maintain a clean, relevant task list by removing obsolete or unnecessary tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting tasks and verifying they are removed from the system. The system should properly remove tasks and not display them in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a task in my list, **When** I delete the task, **Then** it is removed from the task list and no longer appears
2. **Given** I am about to delete a task, **When** I confirm the deletion, **Then** the system removes the task permanently
3. **Given** I accidentally select delete, **When** I cancel the operation, **Then** the task remains in the system unchanged

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to add a task with an empty title? The system should reject tasks with empty titles and prompt the user to provide a valid title.
- How does system handle deletion of a task that doesn't exist? The system should handle this gracefully without error, possibly notifying the user that the task was not found.
- What happens when a user tries to update a task that has been deleted? The system should detect this scenario and inform the user that the task no longer exists.
- How does the system handle very large task details or titles? The system should define reasonable limits (e.g., 100 characters for titles, 1000 characters for details) and enforce them with appropriate validation messages.


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new tasks with a title and optional details
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks in a list format showing title, details, and completion status
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to update task titles and details
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks from the list
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain task completion status (completed/incomplete) persistently
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle task operations without losing data during normal usage
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear visual indication of task completion status
- **FR-009**: System MUST reject tasks with empty titles and prompt users to provide valid titles
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce reasonable limits on task titles (maximum 100 characters) and details (maximum 1000 characters) with appropriate validation


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with properties: title (required), details (optional), completion status (boolean), creation timestamp, modification timestamp
- **TaskList**: Collection of tasks that can be displayed and manipulated by the user

### Constitution Alignment

- **Spec-Driven First**: All functionality must be defined in Markdown specs before implementation
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Implementation must be AI-governable and spec-compliant
- **Test-First**: Each requirement must have clear acceptance criteria defined in specs
- **Cloud-Native by Design**: Architecture must support progressive evolution (Console → API → AI → Cloud → Production)
- **Reusable Intelligence**: Components must be modular and spec-defined for reusability

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add a new task in under 10 seconds from start to completion
- **SC-002**: Users can view their complete task list with up to 100 tasks in under 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: 95% of users successfully complete the primary task management workflow (add, view, update, mark complete, delete)
- **SC-004**: System maintains 99.9% data persistence - tasks are not lost during normal operations
- **SC-005**: Users can update task details and see changes reflected immediately in the task list
- **SC-006**: Task completion status is accurately maintained and displayed consistently across all views
