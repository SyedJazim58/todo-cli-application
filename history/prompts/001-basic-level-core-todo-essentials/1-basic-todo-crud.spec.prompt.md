# Basic Todo CRUD Spec

## Prompt

```
Basic Level – Core Todo Essentials

Target system:
Foundational Todo application forming Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" project.

Scope & focus:
Define clear, unambiguous specifications for core CRUD functionality that can be
fully generated by Claude Code without manual coding.

Modules to specify:
1. Add Task – Create new todo items
2. Delete Task – Remove existing tasks
3. Update Task – Modify task title or details
4. View Task List – Display all tasks
5. Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status
```

## Response

Created comprehensive specification for basic todo CRUD operations with:

- 5 user stories prioritized (P1-P5) covering all CRUD operations
- Detailed acceptance scenarios for each user story
- 10 functional requirements including edge case handling
- 2 key entities (Task and TaskList)
- 6 measurable success criteria
- Edge cases addressed with specific handling strategies

The specification follows the constitution principles and is ready for implementation planning.

## Outcome

The specification document is complete and addresses all CRUD operations for a basic todo application. It includes user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria necessary for AI generation of the implementation.

## Evaluation

The specification is comprehensive, testable, and ready for the next phase of development planning.
